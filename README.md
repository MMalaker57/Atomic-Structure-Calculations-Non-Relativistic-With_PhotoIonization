# Atomic-Structure-Calculations-Non-Relativistic-
Based upon the Herman-Skillman code for calculating non-relativistic Hartree-Fock-Slater wavefunctions. 

The program calculates the Hartree-Fock-Slater wavefunctions of the elements using the non-relativistic methodology put forth by Herman and Skillman. 

The input files necessary to for the program to run the calculations are in the Input-Files branch. These can be placed anywhere on a Mac. If you are running on an iPad, we recommend putting them on an iCloud Drive.
